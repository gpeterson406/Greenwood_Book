## Model	{#section7-1}

In Chapter \@ref(chapter6), we learned how to estimate and interpret 
correlations and regression
equations with a single predictor variable (***simple linear regression*** 
or SLR).
\index{model!SLR}
We carefully explored the variety of things that could go wrong and
how to check for problems in regression situations. In this chapter, that work
provides the basis for performing statistical inference that mainly focuses on
the population slope coefficient based on the sample slope coefficient. As a
reminder, the estimated regression model is $\hat{y}_i = b_0 + b_1x_i$. The
population regression equation is $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \varepsilon_i$ where $\beta_0$ is the ***population*** (or true) ***y-intercept*** and
$\beta_1$ is the ***population*** (or true) ***slope coefficient***. 
These are population parameters (fixed but typically unknown). This model can
be re-written to think about different components and their roles. The mean of
a random variable is statistically denoted as $E(y_i)$, the
***expected value of*** $\mathbf{y_i}$, or as $\mu_{y_i}$ and the mean of the
response variable in a simple linear model is specified by 
$E(y_i) = \mu_{y_i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i$. This uses the true regression line
to define the model for the mean of the responses as a function of the value of
the explanatory variable^[We can also write this as 
$E(y_i|x_i) = \mu\{y_i|x_i\} = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i$, which is the notation you 
will see in books like the *Statistical Sleuth* [@Ramsey2012]. We will 
use notation that is consistent with how we originally introduced the methods.]. 

\indent The other part of any statistical model is specifying a model for the
variability around the mean. 
There are two aspects to the variability to specify here -- the shape of the
distribution and the spread of the distribution. This is where the 
normal distribution
and our "normality assumption" re-appears. And for normal distributions, we
need to define a variance parameter, $\sigma^2$. Combined, the complete 
regression model is

$$y_i \sim N(\mu_{y_i},\sigma^2), \text{ with } 
\mu_{y_i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i,$$

which can be read as "y follows a normal distribution
with mean mu-y and variance sigma-squared" and that "mu-y is equal to beta-0 plus beta-1 times x". This also implies that the random
variability around the true mean, the errors, follow a normal distribution with
mean 0 and that same variance, $\varepsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$. The true 
deviations ($\varepsilon_i$) are once again estimated by the
residuals, $e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$ = observed response -- predicted
response.
\index{residuals}
We can use the residuals to estimate $\sigma$, which is also
called the ***residual standard error***, 
$\hat{\sigma} = \sqrt{\Sigma e^2_i / (n-2)}$. We will find this quantity 
near the end
of the regression output as discussed below so the formula is not heavily used
here. This provides us with the three parameters that are estimated as part of
our SLR model: $\beta_0, \beta_1,\text{ and } \sigma$.

\indent These definitions also formalize the assumptions implicit in the 
regression model: \index{assumptions}

1. The errors follow a normal distribution (***Normality assumption***).

2. The errors have the same variance (***Constant variance assumption***).

3. The observations are independent (***Independence assumption***).
\index{independence assumption!SLR}

4. The model for the mean is "correct" (***Linearity, No Influential points,
Only one group***). 

The diagnostics described at the end of Chapter \@ref(chapter6) provide 
techniques for checking these assumptions -- at least not having clear issues with those assumptions is fundamental to having a regression line that we trust and
inferences from it that we also can trust. 

\indent To make this clearer, suppose that in the *Beers* and *BAC* study that 
they had randomly assigned 20 students to consume each number of beers.
We would expect some
variation in the *BAC* for each group of 20 at each level of *Beers* but 
that each group of observations will be centered at the true mean *BAC*
for each number of *Beers*. The regression model assumes that the *BAC* 
values are normally distributed around the mean for each *Beer* level,
$\text{BAC}_i \sim N(\beta_0 + \beta_1\text{ Beers}_i,\sigma^2)$, with
the mean defined by the regression equation. We actually do not need to 
obtain more than one observation at each $x$ value to
make this assumption or assess it, but the plots below show you what this could
look like. The sketch in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-1) attempts to show 
the idea of normal
distributions that are centered at the true regression line, all with the same
shape and variance that is an assumption of the regression model. Figure
\@ref(fig:Figure7-2) contains simulated realizations from a normal
distribution of 20 subjects at each *Beer* level around the assumed true
regression line with two different residual SEs of 0.02 and 0.06. The original
BAC model has a residual SE of 0.02 but had many fewer observations at each 
*Beer* value.

```

\indent Along with getting the idea that regression models define normal 
distributions in the y-direction that are
centered at the regression line, you can also get a sense of how variable
samples from a normal distribution can appear. Each distribution of 20 subjects
at each $x$ value came from a normal distribution but there are some of those
distributions that might appear to generate small outliers and have slightly
different variances. This can help us to remember to not be too particular when
assessing assumptions and allow for some variability in spreads and a few
observations from the tails of the distribution to occasionally arise. 
\index{assumptions}

\indent In sampling from the population, we expect some amount of variability 
of each estimator around its
true value. This variability leads to the potential variability in estimated
regression lines (think of a suite of potential estimated regression lines that
would be created by different random samples from the same population). 
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-3) contains the true regression line (bold, red)
and realizations of the
estimated regression line in simulated data based on results similar to the
real data set. This variability due to random sampling is something that needs to be
properly accounted for to use the **single** estimated regression line to
make inferences about the true line and parameters based on the sample-based
estimates.
\index{random sampling}
The next sections develop those inferential tools.

Light grey lines are simulated realizations assuming the bold (red) line is the true SLR model and variability is similar to the original BAC data set.

\sectionmark{CI and Hypothesis tests for slope and intercept}

## Confidence interval and hypothesis tests for the slope and intercept	{#section7-2}

\sectionmark{CI and Hypothesis tests for slope and intercept}

Our inference techniques will resemble previous material with an 
interest in forming confidence intervals and
doing hypothesis testing, although the interpretation of confidence intervals
for slope coefficients take some extra care. Remember that the general form of
any parametric \index{parametric} \index{confidence interval} confidence interval is 

$$\text{estimate} \mp t^*\text{SE}_{estimate},$$

so we need to obtain the appropriate standard error for regression model
coefficients and the degrees of freedom to define the $t$-distribution
to look up $t^*$ multiplier.
\index{@$t$-distribution}
We will find the $\text{SE}_{b_0}$ and $\text{SE}_{b_1}$
in the model summary. The degrees of freedom for the $t$-distribution
in simple linear regression are $\mathbf{df=n-2}$.
\index{degrees of freedom!SLR}
Putting this 
together, the confidence interval for the true y-intercept, $\beta_0$, is
$\mathbf{b_0 \mp t^*_{n-2}}\textbf{SE}_{\mathbf{b_0}}$ although this 
confidence interval is rarely of interest. The confidence interval 
that is almost always of interest is for the true slope coefficient,
$\beta_1$, that is $\mathbf{b_1 \mp t^*_{n-2}}\textbf{SE}_{\mathbf{b_1}}$.
The slope confidence interval is used to do two
things: (1) inference for the amount of change in the mean of $y$ for a unit
change in $x$ in the population and (2) to potentially do hypothesis testing by
checking whether 0 is in the CI or not. The sketch in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-4)
illustrates the roles of the
CI for the slope in terms of determining where the population slope, $\beta_1$, coefficient
might be -- centered at the sample slope coefficient -- our best guess for the
true slope. This sketch also informs an ***interpretation of the slope coefficient
confidence interval***:


(ref:fig7-4) Graphic illustrating the confidence interval for a slope coefficient for a 1 unit increase in $x$.

```{r Figure7-4,fig.cap="(ref:fig7-4)",echo=F, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("chapter7_files/image045.png")
```

> For a 1 **[*units of X*]** increase in **X**, we are ___ % confident 
  that the **true change in the mean of** ***Y*** will be between **LL**
  and **UL** **[*units of Y*]**.
>

\index{slope CI interpretation!SLR}

In this interpretation, LL and UL are the calculated lower and upper 
limits of the confidence interval. This builds
on our previous interpretation of the slope coefficient, adding in the
information about pinning down the true change (population change) in the mean
of the response variable for a difference of 1 unit in the $x$-direction. The interpretation of the y-intercept CI is: 
\index{@$y$-intercept CI interpretation!SLR}

> For an ***x*** of 0 **[*units of X*]**, we are 95% confident that
  the true mean of ***Y*** will be between **LL** and **UL**
  **[*units of Y*]**.
>

This is really only interesting if the value of $x=0$ is interesting --
we'll see a method for generating CIs
for the true mean at potentially more interesting values of $x$ in 
Section \@ref(section7-7). To trust the results from these
confidence intervals, it is critical that any issues with the regression validity conditions are minor. \index{validity conditions}

\indent The only hypothesis test of interest in this situation is for the slope
coefficient. 
\index{hypothesis testing}
To develop the hypotheses of interest in SLR, note the effect 
of having $\beta_1=0$ in the mean of the regression equation,
$\mu_{y_i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i = \beta_0 + 0x_i = \beta_0$.
This is the "intercept-only" or "mean-only" model that suggests that 
the mean of $y$ does not vary with different values of $x$ as it is always
$\beta_0$. We saw this model in the ANOVA material as the reduced model when the
null hypothesis of no difference in the true means across the groups was true. 
Here, this is the same as saying that there is no linear relationship between $x$
and $y$, or that $x$ is of no use in predicting $y$, or that we make the same
prediction for $y$ for every value of $x$. Thus

$$\boldsymbol{H_0: \beta_1=0}$$

is a test for **no linear relationship between** $\mathbf{x}$ **and** $\mathbf{y}$
**in the population**. The alternative of $\boldsymbol{H_A: \beta_1\ne 0}$,
that there is **some** linear relationship between $x$ and $y$ in the population,
is our main test of interest in these situations. It is also possible to test
greater than or less than alternatives in certain situations. 

\indent Test statistics for regression coefficients are developed, if we can trust our assumptions, using the $t$-distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom.
\index{degrees of freedom!SLR}
The $t$-test statistic is generally

$$t=\frac{b_i}{\text{SE}_{b_i}}$$

with the main interest in the test for $\beta_1$ based on $b_1$ initially.
The p-value would be calculated using the two-tailed area from the 
$t_{n-2}$ distribution calculated using the ``pt`` function.
\index{\texttt{pt()}}
The p-value 
to test these hypotheses is also provided
in the model summary as we will see below. \index{p-value!calculation of}

\indent The greater than or
less than alternatives can have interesting interpretations in certain
situations. For example, the greater than alternative 
$\left(\boldsymbol{H_A: \beta_1 > 0}\right)$ tests an alternative of a
positive linear relationship, with the p-value extracted just from the 
right tail of the same $t$-distribution. This could be
used when a researcher would only find a result "interesting" if a positive
relationship is detected, such as in the study of tree height and tree diameter
where a researcher might be justified in deciding to test only for a positive
linear relationship. Similarly, the left-tailed alternative is also possible,
$\boldsymbol{H_A: \beta_1 < 0}$. To get one-tailed p-values from two-tailed
results (the default), first check that the observed test statistic is
in the direction of the alternative ($t>0$ for $H_A:\beta_1>0$ or $t<0$
for $H_A:\beta_1<0$).
\index{p-value!one-sided test}
**If these conditions are met, then the p-value for 
the one-sided test from the two-sided version is found by dividing the
reported p-value by 2**. If $t>0$ for $H_A:\beta_1>0$ or $t<0$
for $H_A:\beta_1<0$ are not met, then the p-value would be greater than
0.5 and it would be easiest to look it up directly using ``pt`` using the tail area direction in the direction of the alternative.
\index{\texttt{pt()}}

\indent We can revisit a couple of examples for a last time with these ideas in 
hand to complete the analyses. 

> For the *Beers, BAC* data, the 95% confidence for the true slope
> coefficient, $\beta_1$, is
>   
 
$$\begin{array}{rl}
\boldsymbol{b_1 \mp t^*_{n-2}} \textbf{SE}_{\boldsymbol{b_1}}
& \boldsymbol{= 0.01796 \mp 2.144787 * 0.002402} \\
& \boldsymbol{= 0.01796 \mp 0.00515} \\
& \boldsymbol{\rightarrow (0.0128, 0.0231).}
\end{array}$$

You can find the components of this
calculation in the model summary and from ``qt(0.975, df=n-2)`` which was 
2.145 for the $t^*$-multiplier. Be careful not to use the $t$-value of 
7.48 in the model summary to
make confidence intervals -- that is the test statistic used below. The related
calculations are shown at the bottom of the following code:

\vspace{24pt}

```{r}
m1 <- lm(BAC~Beers, data=BB)

summary(m1)
```

\vspace{11pt}

```{r}
qt(0.975, df=14) # t* multiplier for 95% CI
0.017964 + c(-1,1)*qt(0.975, df=14)*0.002402
qt(0.975, df=14)*0.002402
```

\vspace{11pt}

We can also get the confidence interval
directly from the ``confint`` function run on our regression model, 
saving some calculation
effort and providing both the CI for the y-intercept and the slope coefficient. \index{\texttt{confint()}}

```{r}
confint(m1)
```

We interpret the 95% CI for the slope coefficient as follows: For a 
1 **beer** increase in number of beers consumed, we are 95% confident that
the **true** change in the **mean** *BAC* will be between 0.0128 and 0.0231
g/dL. While the estimated slope is our best guess of the impacts of an extra
beer consumed based on our sample, this CI provides information about the likely
range of potential impacts on the mean in the population. It also could be used
to test the two-sided hypothesis test and would suggest strong evidence against
the null hypothesis since the confidence interval does not contain 0, but its main use is to quantify where we think the true slope coefficient resides. 

\indent The width of the CI, interpreted loosely as the precision of the estimated slope, is
impacted by the variability of
the observations around the estimated regression line, the overall sample size, 
and the positioning of the $x$-observations. Basically all those aspects relate
to how "clearly" known the regression line is and that determines the estimated
precision in the slope. For example, the more variability around the line that
is present, the more uncertainty there is about the correct line to use 
(Least Squares (LS) can
still find an estimated line but there are other lines that might be "close" to
its optimizing choice). Similarly, more observations help us get a better 
estimate of the mean -- an idea that permeates all statistical methods. Finally, 
the location of $x$-values can impact the precision in a slope coefficient. We'll
revisit this in the context of ***multi-collinearity*** in the next chapter,
and often we have no control of $x$-values, but just note that different
patterns of $x$-values can lead to different precision of estimated slope
coefficients^[There is an area of statistical research on how to 
optimally choose $x$-values to
get the most precise estimate of a slope coefficient. In observational studies
we have to deal with whatever pattern of $x\text{'s}$ we ended up with. If you can
choose, generate an even spread of $x\text{'s}$ over some range of
interest similar to what was used in the *Beers* vs *BAC* study to provide
the best distribution of values to discover the relationship across the 
selected range of $x$-values.].

\indent For hypothesis testing, we will almost always stick with two-sided tests
in regression modeling as it is a more conservative approach and does not require
us to have an expectation of a direction for relationships *a priori*. In this
example, the null hypothesis for the slope coefficient is that there is no
linear relationship between *Beers* and *BAC* in the population. The
alternative hypothesis is that there is
some linear relationship between *Beers* and *BAC* in the population. The
test statistic is $t=0.01796/0.002402 =7.48$ which, if model assumptions hold,
follows a $t(14)$ distribution under the null hypothesis. The model summary provides the calculation 
of the test statistic
and the two-sided test p-value of $2.97\text{e-6} = 0.00000297$. So we 
would just report
"p-value < 0.0001". This suggests that there is very strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no linear
relationship between *Beers* and *BAC* in the population, so we would conclude that there is a linear relationship between them. Because of the
random assignment, we can also say that drinking beers causes changes in BAC
but, because the sample was made up of volunteers, we cannot infer that these results
would hold in the general population of OSU students or more generally.

\indent There are also results for the y-intercept in the output. The 95% CI is 
from -0.0398 to 0.0144, that the true mean *BAC* for a 0 beer consuming 
subject is between
-0.0398 to 0.01445. This is really not a big surprise but possibly is
comforting to know that these results would not show much evidence against the null hypothesis
that the true mean *BAC* for 0 *Beers* is 0. Finding little evidence of a
difference from 0 makes sense and makes the estimated y-intercept of -0.013 not
so problematic. In other situations, the results for the y-intercept may be
more illogical but this will often be because the y-intercept is extrapolating
far beyond the scope of observations. The y-intercept's main function in
regression models is to be at the right level for the slope to "work" to make a
line that describes the responses and thus is usually of lesser interest even though it plays an important role in the model. 

\indent As a second example, we can revisit modeling the *Hematocrit* of female
Australian athletes as a function of *body fat %*. The sample size is $n=99$
so the *df* are 97 in any $t$-distributions. In Chapter \@ref(chapter6), the 
relationship between *Hematocrit* and *body fat %* for females appeared to 
be a weak negative linear
association. The 95% confidence interval for the slope is -0.186 to 0.0155. For
a 1% increase in body fat %, we are 95% confident that the change in the true
mean Hematocrit is between -0.186 and 0.0155% of blood. This suggests that we
would find little evidence against the null hypothesis of no linear relationship because this CI contains 0. In fact the p-value is 0.0965 which is larger than 0.05
and so provides a consistent conclusion with using the 95% confidence interval
to perform a hypothesis test. Either way, we would conclude that there is not strong evidence against the null hypothesis but there is some evidence against it with a p-value of that size since more extreme results are somewhat common but still fairly rare if we assume the null is true. If you think p-values around 0.10 provide moderate evidence, you might have a different opinion about
the evidence against the null hypothesis here. For this reason, we sometimes
interpret this sort of marginal result as having some or marginal evidence against the null
but certainly would never say that this presents strong evidence.

\indent One more worked example is provided from the Montana fire data. In this 
example pay particular attention
to how we are handling the units of the response variable, log-hectares, and to
the changes to doing inferences with a 99% confidence
level CI, and where you can find the needed results in the following output:

```

* Based on the estimated regression model, we can say that if the 
average temperature is 0, we expect that, on average, the log-area 
burned would be -69.8 log-hectares. 

* From the regression model summary, $b_1=1.39$ with 
$\text{SE}_{b_1}=0.2165$ and $\mathbf{t=6.41}$.

* There were $n=23$ measurements taken, so $\mathbf{df=n-2=23-3=21}$.

* Suppose that we want to test for a linear relationship between 
temperature and log-hectares burned:

    $$H_0: \beta_1=0$$

    * In words, the true slope coefficient between *Temperature* and 
    *log-area burned* is 0 OR there is no linear relationship between
    *Temperature* and *log-area burned* in the population.
    
    $$H_A: \beta_1\ne 0$$

    * In words, the alternative states that the true slope coefficient
    between *Temperature* and *log-area burned* is not 0 OR there is a 
    linear relationship between *Temperature* and *log-area burned* in 
    the population. 

Test statistic: $t = 1.39/0.217 = 6.41$

* Assuming the null hypothesis to be true (no linear relationship), the 
$t$-statistic follows a $t$-distribution with $n-2 = 23-2=21$ degrees of 
freedom (or simply $t_{21}$). 

p-value:

* From the model summary, the **p-value is** $\mathbf{2.35*10^{-6}}$

    * Interpretation: There is less than a 0.01% chance that we would 
    observe slope coefficient like we did or something more extreme 
    (greater than 1.39 log(hectares)/$^\circ F$) if there were in fact 
    no linear relationship between temperature ($^\circ F$) and log-area 
    burned (log-hectares) in the population. 

Conclusion: There is very strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no 
linear relationship, so we would conclude that there
is, in fact, a linear relationship between Temperature and log(Hectares)
burned. 

Scope of Inference: Since we have a time series of results, our inferences pertain to the
results we could have observed for these years but not for years we did not
observe -- so just for the true slope for this sample of years. Because we can't
randomly assign the amount of area burned, we cannot make causal inferences --
there are many reasons why both the average temperature and area burned would
vary together that would not involve a direct connection between them. 

$$\text{99}\% \text{ CI for } \beta_1: \boldsymbol{b_1 \mp
t^*_{n-2}}\textbf{SE}_{\boldsymbol{b_1}} \rightarrow 1.39 \mp 2.831\bullet 0.217
\rightarrow (0.78, 2.00)$$


Interpretation of 99% CI for slope coefficient:

* For a 1 degree F increase in *Temperature*, we are 99% confident that the 
change in the true mean log-area burned is between 0.78 and 2.00 log(Hectares).

Another way to interpret this is:

* For a 1 degree F increase in *Temperature*, we are 99% confident that
the mean Area Burned will change by between 0.78 and 2.00 log(Hectares)
**in the population**.

Also $R^2$ is 66.2%, which tells us that *Temperature* explains 66.2%
of the variation in *log(Hectares) burned*. Or that the linear regression
model built using *Temperature* explains 66.2% of the variation in yearly
*log(Hectares) burned* so this model explains quite a bit but not all the variation in the responses.
 
## Bozeman temperature trend	{#section7-3}

For a new example, consider the yearly average maximum temperatures in Bozeman, MT. 
For over 100 years, daily measurements have been taken of the minimum and
maximum temperatures at hundreds of weather stations across the US. In early
years, this involved manual recording of the temperatures and resetting the
thermometer to track the extremes for the following day. More recently, these
measures have been replaced by digital temperature recording devices that
continue to track this sort of information with much less human effort and, 
possibly, errors. This sort of information is often aggregated to monthly or
yearly averages to be able to see "on average" changes from month-to-month or
year-to-year as opposed to the day-to-day variation in the temperature^[See
http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-city-has-the-most-unpredictable-weather/
for an interesting discussion of
weather variability where Great Falls, MT had a very high rating on
"unpredictability".]. Often the local information is aggregated further to
provide regional, hemispheric, or even global average temperatures. Climate
change research involves attempting to quantify the changes over time in these
and other long-term temperature or temperature proxies. 

\indent These data were extracted from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information's database
(http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/) and we will focus on the yearly
average of the monthly averages of the daily maximum temperature in Bozeman in degrees
F from 1901 to 2014. We can call
them yearly average maximum temperatures but note that it was a little more
complicated than that to arrive at the response variable we are analyzing. 

```{r eval=F}
bozemantemps <- read_csv("http://www.math.montana.edu/courses/s217/documents/BozemanMeanMax.csv")
```

```{r echo=F}
bozemantemps <- read_csv("BozemanMeanMax.csv")
```

(ref:fig7-5) Scatterplot of average yearly maximum temperatures in Bozeman from 1900 to 2014 with SLR (solid) and smoothing (dashed) lines.

```{r Figure7-5,fig.cap="(ref:fig7-5)",error=F,message=F,fig.height=5,fig.width=10}
summary(bozemantemps)
length(bozemantemps$Year) #Some years are missing (1905, 1906, 1948, 1950,1995)
library(car)
scatterplot(meanmax~Year, data=bozemantemps, 
            ylab="Mean Maximum Temperature (degrees F)", smooth=list(spread=F),
            main="Scatterplot of Bozeman Yearly Average Max Temperatures")
```

The scatterplot in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-5) shows the results between 
1901 and 2014 based on a sample of $n=109$ years because four years had too
many missing months to fairly include in the responses. Missing values occur 
for many reasons and in
this case were likely just machine or human error^[It is actually pretty 
amazing that there are hundreds of locations with nearly complete daily 
records for over 100 years.]. 
These are time series data and in time series analysis we assume that the
population of interest for inference is all possible realizations from the
underlying process over this time frame even though we only ever get to observe
one realization. In terms of climate change research, we would want to (a)
assess evidence for a trend over time (hopefully assessing whether any observed
trend is clearly different from a result that could have been observed by
chance if there really is no change over time in the true process) and (b)
quantify the size of the change over time along with the uncertainty in that
estimate relative to the underlying true mean change over time. The hypothesis
test for the slope answers (a) and the confidence interval for the slope
addresses (b). We also should be concerned about problematic (influential)
points, changing variance, and potential nonlinearity in the trend over time
causing problems for the SLR inferences. The scatterplot suggests that there is
a moderate or strong positive linear relationship between *temperatures* and
*year*. Both looking at the points and at the smoothing line does not suggest a clear curve in these responses over time and the variability seems similar across the years. There appears to be one potential large outlier
in the late 1930s. 

\indent We'll perform all 6+ steps of the hypothesis test for the slope coefficient 
and use the confidence
interval interpretation to discuss the size of the change.
\index{hypothesis testing}
First, we need to select our hypotheses (the 2-sided test
would be a ***conservative*** choice and no one that does climate change
research wants to be accused of taking a ***liberal*** approach in their analyses^[All joking aside, if researchers can find evidence of climate 
change using ***conservative*** methods (methods that reject the null 
hypothesis when it is true less often than stated), then their results are 
even harder to ignore.]) and our test statistic, $t=\frac{b_1}{\text{SE}_{b_1}}$. The scatterplot is the perfect tool to illustrate the situation.

1. **Hypotheses for the slope coefficient test:**

$$H_0: \beta_1=0 \text{ vs } H_A: \beta_1 \ne 0$$

2. **Validity conditions:**

* **Quantitative variables condition**

    * Both ``Year`` and yearly average ``Temperature`` are 
    quantitative variables so are suitable for an SLR analysis.
    
* **Independence of observations**

    * There may be a lack of independence among years since a warm 
    year might be followed by another warmer than average year. It 
    would take more sophisticated models to
    account for this and the standard error on the slope coefficient could
    either get larger or smaller depending on the type of 
    ***autocorrelation*** (correlation between neighboring time points or
    correlation with oneself at some time
    lag) present. This creates a caveat on these results but this model is
    often the first one researchers fit in these situations and often is
    reasonably correct even in the presence of some autocorrelation. \index{autocorrelation}

To assess the remaining conditions, we need to fit the regression model and use
the diagnostic plots in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-6) to aid our assessment:

(ref:fig7-6) Diagnostic plots of the Bozeman yearly temperature simple linear regression model.

```{r Figure7-6,fig.cap="(ref:fig7-6)",fig.height=4,fig.width=10}
temp1 <- lm(meanmax~Year, data=bozemantemps)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(temp1, add.smooth=F)
```

* **Linearity of relationship**

    * Examine the Residuals vs Fitted plot:
    \index{Residuals vs Fitted plot}
    
        * There does not appear to be a clear curve remaining in 
        the residuals so we should be able to proceed without worrying too much 
        about missed nonlinearity. 

* **Equal (constant) variance**

    * Examining the Residuals vs Fitted and the "Scale-Location" plots 
    provide little to no evidence of changing
    variance.
    \index{Residuals vs Fitted plot}
    \index{Scale-Location plot}
    The variability does decrease slightly in the middle fitted
    values but those changes are really minor and present no real evidence of
    changing variability. 

* **Normality of residuals**

    * Examining the Normal QQ-plot for violations of the normality 
    assumption shows only one real problem in the outlier from the 
    32^nd^ observation in the data set (the temperature observed in 1934)
    which was identified as a large outlier when examining the original scatterplot.
    \index{QQ-plot}
    We should be careful about inferences that assume normality and contain this
    point in the analysis. We might consider running the analysis with it and
    without that point to see how much it impacts the results just to be sure
    it isn't creating evidence of a trend because of a violation of the
    normality assumption. The next check reassures us that re-running the
    model without this point would only result in slightly changing the SEs
    and not the slopes. 

* **No influential points:**

    * There are no influential points displayed in the Residuals vs 
    Leverage plot since the Cook's D contours are not displayed. \index{influential} \index{Cook's Distance}
    \index{Residuals vs Leverage plot}
    
        * Note: by default this plot contains a smoothing line that is
        relatively meaningless, so ignore it
        if is displayed. We suppressed it using the ``add.smooth=F``
        option in ``plot(temp1)`` but if you forget to do that, just 
        ignore the smoothers in the diagnostic plots especially in
        the Residuals vs Leverage plot. \index{Residuals vs Leverage plot}
        
    * These results tells us that the outlier was not influential. If 
    you look back at the scatterplot, it was
    located near the middle of the observed $x\text{'s}$ so its 
    potential leverage is low. You can find its leverage based on the 
    plot to be around 0.12 when there are observations in the data set 
    with leverages over 0.3. The high leverage points occur at the 
    beginning and the end of the record because they are at the edges of 
    the observed $x\text{'s}$ and most of these points follow the overall
    pattern fairly well.

So the main issues are with the assumption of independence
of observations and one non-influential outlier that might be compromising our
normality assumption a bit. 

3. **Calculate the test statistic and p-value:**

    * $t=0.05244/0.00476 = 11.02$
    
    ```{r}
    summary(temp1)
    ```

    * From the model summary: p-value < 2e-16 or just < 0.0001

    * The test statistic is assumed to follow a $t$-distribution with $n-2=109-2=107$ degrees of freedom. The p-value can also be calculated as:

    ```{r}
    2*pt(11.02, df=107, lower.tail=F)
    ```

    * Which is then reported as < 0.0001, which means that the chances of observing a slope coefficient as extreme or more extreme than 0.052 if the null hypothesis of no linear relationship is true is less than 0.01%. 

4. **Write a conclusion:**

    * There is very strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no linear relationship
    between *Year* and yearly mean *Temperature* so we can conclude that
    there is, in fact, some linear relationship between *Year* and yearly mean 
    maximum *Temperature* in Bozeman. 

\newpage

5. **Size:**

    * For a one year increase in Year, we estimate that, on average, the yearly average maximum temperature will change by 0.0524 $^\circ F$ (95% CI: 0.043 to 0.062). This suggests a modest but noticeable change in the mean temperature in Bozeman and the confidence suggests minimal variation around this estimate, going from 0.04 to 0.06 $^\circ F$. The "size" of this change is discussed more in Section \@ref(section7-5).
    
    ```{r}
    confint(temp1)
    ```

6. **Scope of inference:**

    * We can conclude that this detected trend pertains to the Bozeman
    area in the years 1901 to 2014 but not outside of either this area or time frame. We
    cannot say that time caused the observed changes since it was not randomly
    assigned and we cannot attribute the changes to any other factors because we
    did not consider them. But knowing that there was a trend toward increasing
    temperatures is an intriguing first step in a more complete analysis of changing climate in
    the area. 

\indent It is also good to report the percentage of variation that the model explains:
*Year* explains 54.91% of the variation in yearly average maximum *Temperature*.
If the coefficient of determination value had been very
small, we might discount the previous result. Since it is moderately large, 
that suggests that just by using a linear trend over time we can account for
quite a bit of the variation in yearly average maximum temperatures in Bozeman. 
Note that the percentage of variation explained would get much worse if we
tried to analyze the monthly or original daily maximum temperature data even though we might find about the same estimated mean change over time. 

\indent Interpreting a confidence interval provides more useful information than the
hypothesis test here --
instead of just assessing evidence against the null hypothesis, we can actually
provide our best guess at the true change in the mean of $y$ for a change in $x$. 
Here, the 95% CI is (0.043, 0.062). This tells us that for a 1 year increase in *Year*, we are 95% confident that the change in the true mean of the yearly average maximum *Temperatures* in Bozeman is between 0.043 and 0.062 $^\circ F$. 

\indent Sometimes the scale of the $x$-variable makes interpretation a little difficult,
so we can re-scale it
to make the resulting slope coefficient more interpretable without changing how the model fits the responses. One option is to re-scale the variable and
re-fit the regression model and the other (easier) option is to re-scale our
interpretation. The idea here is that a 100-year change might be easier and
more meaningful scale to interpret than a single year change. If we have a
slope in the model of 0.052 (for a 1 year change), we can also say that a 100
year change in the mean is estimated to be 0.052*100 = 0.52$^\circ F$.
Similarly, the 95% CI for the
population mean 100-year change would be from
0.43$^\circ F$ to 0.62$^\circ F$. In 2007, the IPCC
(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change;
http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/tssts-3-1-1.html) 
estimated the global temperature change from 1906 to 2005 to be 
0.74$^\circ C$ per decade or, scaled up, 7.4$^\circ C$ per century 
(1.33$^\circ F$). There are many reasons why our
local temperature trend might differ, including that our analysis was of
average maximum temperatures and the IPCC was considering the average
temperature (which was not measured locally or in most places in a good way
until digital instrumentation was installed) and that local trends are likely
to vary around the global average change based on localized environmental
conditions. 

\indent One issue that arises in studies of climate change is that researchers 
often consider these sorts
of tests at many locations and on many response variables (if I did the maximum
temperature, why not also do the same analysis of the minimum temperature time
series as well? And if I did the analysis for Bozeman, what about Butte and
Helena and...?). Remember our discussion of multiple testing issues? This issue can arise when regression
modeling is repeated in many similar data sets, say different sites or
different response variables or both, in one study. In @Moore2007, we considered the impacts on the assessment of evidence of trends
of earlier spring onset timing in the Mountain West when the number of tests
across many sites is accounted for. We found that the evidence for time trends
decreases substantially but does not disappear. In a related study, @Greenwood2011
found evidence for regional trends to earlier spring
onset using more sophisticated statistical models. The main point here is to
**be careful when using simple statistical methods repeatedly if you are 
not accounting for the number of tests performed**.\index{type I error} \index{multiple testing} 

\indent Along with the confidence interval, we can also plot the estimated model 
(Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-7)) using a term-plot from the ``effects`` package
(Fox, 2003). This is the same function we used for visualizing results
in the ANOVA models and in its basic application you just need 
``plot(allEffects(MODELNAME))`` although we from time to time, we will add some options.
\index{\texttt{allEffects()}}
\index{R packages!\textbf{effects}}
In 
regression models, we get to see the regression line along with bounds for
95% confidence intervals for the mean at every value of $x$ that was observed
(explained in the next section). Note that there is also a rugplot on the $x$-axis
showing you where values of the explanatory variable were obtained, which is
useful to understanding how much information is available for different aspects
of the line. Here it provides gaps for missing years of observations as sort of
broken teeth in a comb. Also not used here, we can also turn on the ``residuals=T`` option, which in SLR just plots the original points and adds a smoothing line to this plot to reinforce the previous assessment of assumptions.

(ref:fig7-7) Term-plot for the Bozeman mean yearly maximum temperature linear regression model with 95% confidence interval bands for the mean in each year.

```{r Figure7-7,fig.cap="(ref:fig7-7)",message=F,warning=F}
library(effects)
plot(allEffects(temp1, xlevels=list(Year=bozemantemps$Year)),
     grid=T)
```

\indent If we extended the plot for the model to ``Year`` = 0, we could see the
reason that the y-intercept in this model is -47.4$^\circ F$. This is 
obviously a large extrapolation for these data and provides a silly result.
However, in paleoclimate data that goes back
thousands of years using tree rings, ice cores, or sea sediments, the estimated
mean in year 0 might be interesting and within the scope of observed values or it might not. For example, in @Santibanez2018, the data were a time series from 27,000 to about 9,000 years before present extracted from Antarctic ice cores. It all depends on the application. 

\indent To make the y-intercept more interesting for our data set, we can re-scale 
the $x\text{'s}$ before we fit the
model to have the first year in the data set (1901) be "0". This is
accomplished by calculating $\text{Year2} = \text{Year}-1901$.


```{r}
bozemantemps$Year2 <- bozemantemps$Year - 1901
summary(bozemantemps$Year2)
```

The new estimated regression equation is
$\widehat{\text{Temp}}_i = 52.34 + 0.052\cdot\text{Year2}_i$. The slope and
its test statistic are the same as in the previous model. The y-intercept 
has changed dramatically with a 95% CI from 51.72$^\circ F$ to 52.96$^\circ F$
for ``Year2``=0. But we know that ``Year2`` has a 0 value for 1901 because 
of our subtraction. That means that this CI is
for the true mean in 1901 and is now at least somewhat interesting. If you
revisit Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-7) you will actually see that the displayed
confidence intervals
provide upper and lower bounds that match this result for 1901 -- the
y-intercept CI matches the 95% CI for the true mean in the first year of the data set. 

```{r}
temp2 <- lm(meanmax~Year2, data=bozemantemps)
summary(temp2)
```



```{r}
confint(temp2)
```

\indent Ideally, we want to find a regression model that does not violate any 
assumptions, has a high $\mathbf{R^2}$ value, and a slope coefficient 
with a small p-value. If any of these are not the case, then we are
not completely satisfied with the regression and **should be suspicious
of any inference we perform**. We can sometimes resolve some of the 
systematic issues noted above using ***transformations***, discussed in
Sections \@ref(section7-5) and \@ref(section7-6).
\index{transformation}

## Randomization-based inferences for the slope coefficient	{#section7-4}

Exploring permutation testing in SLR provides an opportunity to gauge the observed
relationship against the sorts of relationships we would expect to see if there
was no linear relationship between the variables. If the relationship is linear
(not curvilinear) and the null hypothesis of $\beta_1=0$ is true, then any
configuration of the responses relative to the
predictor variable's values is as good as any other.
\index{permutation!test}
Consider the four scatterplots of
the Bozeman temperature data versus ``Year`` and permuted versions of ``Year``
in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-8). First, think about which of the panels you 
think present the most
evidence of a linear relationship between ``Year`` and ``Temperature``? 

(ref:fig7-8) Plot of the ``Temperature`` responses versus four versions of ``Year``, three of which are permutations of the Year variable relative to the Temperatures.

```{r Figure7-8,fig.cap="(ref:fig7-8)",echo=F,fig.height=4,fig.width=8}

d1$Year <- shuffle(d1$Year)
plot(meanmax~Year,data=d1,xlab="Year",ylab="Maximum Temperature",main="(a)")
abline(lm(meanmax~Year,data=d1)$coefficients,lwd=2,col="red")

d1 <- bozemantemps
d1$Year <- shuffle(d1$Year)
plot(meanmax~Year,data=d1,xlab="Year",ylab="Maximum Temperature",main="(b)")
abline(lm(meanmax~Year,data=d1)$coefficients,lwd=2,col="red")

d1 <- bozemantemps
d1$Year <- shuffle(d1$Year)
plot(meanmax~Year,data=bozemantemps,xlab="Year",ylab="Maximum Temperature",main="(c)")
abline(lm(meanmax~Year,data=bozemantemps)$coefficients,lwd=2,col="red")

set.seed(97531)

d1 <- bozemantemps
d1$Year <- shuffle(d1$Year)
plot(meanmax~Year,data=d1,xlab="Year",ylab="Maximum Temperature",main="(d)")
abline(lm(meanmax~Year,data=d1)$coefficients,lwd=2,col="red")
```

\indent Hopefully you can see that panel (c) contains the most clear linear 
relationship among the choices. The plot in
panel (c) is actually the real data set and pretty clearly presents itself as
"different" from the other results. When we have small p-values, the real data
set will be clearly different from the permuted results because it will be
almost impossible to find a permuted data set that can attain as large a slope
coefficient as was observed in the real data set^[It took many permutations
to get competitor plots this close to the real data set and they really 
aren't that close.]. This result ties back into our original interests 
in this climate change research
situation -- does our result look like it is different from what could have been
observed just by chance if there were no linear relationship between $x$
and $y$? It seems unlikely...

\indent Repeating this permutation process and tracking the estimated slope 
coefficients, as $T^*$, provides another method to obtain a p-value in 
SLR applications. This could also be performed on the $t$-statistic for 
the slope coefficient and would provide the same p-values but the sampling
distribution would have a
different $x$-axis scaling. In this situation, the observed slope of 0.052 is
really far from any possible values that can be obtained using permutations as
shown in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-9). The p-value would be reported as 
$<0.001$ for the two-sided permutation test.

plot(density(Tstar), main="Density curve of Tstar", xlim=c(-1,1)*Tobs)
abline(v=c(-1,1)*Tobs, col="red", lwd=3)
```

\indent One other interesting aspect of exploring the permuted data sets as in 
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-8) is that the outlier
in the late 1930s "disappears" in the permuted data sets because there were
many other observations that were that warm, just none that happened around
that time of the century in the real data set. This reinforces the evidence for
changes over time that seem to be present in these data -- old unusual years
don't look unusual in more recent years (which is a pretty concerning result). 

\indent The permutation approach can be useful in situations where the normality assumption
is compromised, but there are no influential points. In these situations, we
might find more trustworthy p-values using permutations but only if we are
working with an initial estimated regression equation that we generally trust. 
I personally like the permutation approach as a way of explaining what a p-value
is actually measuring -- the chance of seeing something like what we saw, or
more extreme, if the null is true.
\index{permutation!test!interpretation of}
\index{p-value!interpretation of}
And the previous scatterplots show what the
"by chance" versions of this relationship might look like. 

\indent In a similar situation where we want to focus on confidence intervals for slope
coefficients but are not completely comfortable with the normality assumption, 
it is also possible to generate bootstrap confidence intervals by sampling with
replacement from the data set. This idea was introduced in 
Sections \@ref(section2-8) and \@ref(section2-9). This provides a 95% 
bootstrap confidence interval from 0.433 to 0.61, 
which almost exactly matches the parametric $t$-based confidence interval. The
bootstrap distributions are very symmetric (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-10)).
The interpretation is
the same and this result reinforces the other assessments that the parametric
approach is not unreasonable here except possibly for the independence assumption. These randomization approaches provide no robustness against violations of the independence assumption. \index{independence assumption!SLR}

## Transformations part I: Linearizing relationships	{#section7-5}

When the influential point, linearity, constant variance and/or normality
assumptions are clearly violated, we cannot trust any of the inferences generated by the
regression model. The violations occur on gradients from minor to really major
problems. As we have seen from the examples in the previous chapters, it has
been hard to find data sets that were free of all issues. Furthermore, it may
seem hopeless to be able to make successful inferences in some of these
situations with the previous tools. There are three potential solutions to violations
of the validity conditions: \index{validity conditions}

1. Consider removing an offending point or two and see if this improves the results, 
presenting results both with and without those points to describe their impact^[If
the removal is of a point that is extreme in $x$-values, then it is appropriate
to note that the results only apply to the restricted range of $x$-values that
were actually analyzed in the scope of inference discussion. Our results only ever apply to the range of $x$-values we
had available so this is a relatively minor change.], 

2. Try to transform the response, explanatory, or both variables and see if you can
force the data set to meet our SLR assumptions after transformation (the focus
of this and the next section), or \index{transformation} \index{assumptions}

3. Consider more advanced statistical models that can account for these issues 
(the focus of subsequent statistics courses, if you continue on further). 

\indent `r textItalicBold("Transformations")` involve applying a function to 
one or both variables.
\index{transformation}
After applying this transformation, one hopes to have
alleviated whatever issues encouraged its consideration. ***Linear transformation 
functions***, of the form $z_{\text{new}}=a*x+b$, will never help us to fix
assumptions in regression situations; linear transformations change the scaling
of the variables but not their shape or the relationship between two variables. 
For example, in the Bozeman Temperature data example, we subtracted 1901 from
the ``Year`` variable to have ``Year2`` start at 0 and go up to 113. We could
also apply a linear transformation to change Temperature from being measured in
$^\circ F$ to $^\circ C$ using $^\circ C=[^\circ F - 32] *(5/9)$. The 
scatterplots on both the original and transformed scales are provided in 
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-11). All the
coefficients in the regression model and the labels on the axes change, but the
"picture" is still the same. Additionally, all the inferences remain the same --
 p-values are unchanged by linear transformations. So linear transformations
can be "fun" but really are only useful if they make the coefficients easier to
interpret.
\index{transformation!linear}
Here if you like temperature changes in $^\circ C$ for a 1 year increase, the 
slope coefficient is 0.029 and if you like the original change in $^\circ F$ for
a 1 year increase, the slope coefficient is 0.052. More useful than this is the switch into units of 100 years (so each year increase would just be 0.1 instead of 1), so that the slope is the temperature change over 100 years.

\indent `r textItalicBold("Nonlinear transformation functions")`
are where we apply something more complicated than this
shift and scaling, something like $y_{\text{new}}=f(y)$, where $f(\cdot)$ could be 
a log or power of the original variable $y$. When we apply these sorts of
transformations, 
interesting things can happen to our linear models and their problems.
\index{transformation!nonlinear}
Some
examples of transformations that are at least occasionally used for transforming
the response variable are provided in Table \@ref(tab:Table7-1), ranging from taking 
$y$ to different powers from $y^{-2}$ to $y^2$. Typical transformations used in statistical
modeling exist along a gradient of powers of the response variable, defined as $y^{\lambda}$
with $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ being the power of the transformation of the response 
variable and $\lambda = 0$ implying a log-transformation. Except for $\lambda = 1$, the
transformations are all nonlinear functions of $y$.

There are even more transformations possible, for example $y^{0.33}$ is sometimes useful 
for variables
involved in measuring the volume of something. And we can also consider
applying any of these transformations to the explanatory variable, and consider
using them on both the response and explanatory variables at the same time. The
most common application of these ideas is to transform the response variable using
the log-transformation, at least as a starting point. In fact, the
log-transformation is so commonly used (or maybe overused), that we will just focus
on its use. It is so commonplace in some fields that some researchers
log-transform their data prior to even plotting it. In other
situations, such as when measuring acidity (pH), noise (decibels), or
earthquake size (Richter scale), the measurements are already on logarithmic
scales.

\indent Actually, we have already analyzed data that benefited from a
***log-transformation*** -- the *log-area burned* vs. *summer temperature*
data for Montana. Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-12) compares the
relationship between these variables on the original hectares scale and the
log-hectares scale. 

\newpage

```{r eval=F}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(hectares~Temperature, data=mtfires, main="(a)",
     ylab="Hectares", pch=16)
plot(loghectares~Temperature, data=mtfires, main="(b)",
     ylab="log-Hectares", pch=16)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-12)(a) displays a relationship
that would be hard fit using SLR -- it has a curve and the
variance is increasing with increasing temperatures. With a 
log-transformation of *Hectares*, the relationship appears to be relatively
linear and have constant variance (in (b)). We considered regression models for this
situation previously. This shows at least one situation where a
log-transformation of a response variable can linearize a relationship and
reduce non-constant variance. 

\indent This transformation does not always work to "fix" curvilinear 
relationships, in fact
in some situations it can make the relationship more nonlinear. For example, 
reconsider the relationship between tree diameter and tree height, which
contained some curvature that we could not account for in an SLR. 
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-13) shows
the original version of the variables and Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-14)
shows the same
information with the response variable (height) log-transformed. 
\index{R packages!\textbf{spuRs}}

            main="Tree height vs tree diameter")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-14) with the log-transformed height response seems 
to show a more nonlinear relationship and may even have more
issues with non-constant variance. This example shows that log-transforming
the response variable cannot fix all problems, even though I've seen some
researchers assume it can. It is OK to try a transformation but remember to
always plot the results to make sure it actually helped and did not make the
situation worse. 

(ref:fig7-14) Scatterplot of log(tree height) versus tree diameter. 

```{r Figure7-14,fig.cap="(ref:fig7-14)",echo=F}
scatterplot(log(height.m)~dbh.cm, data=ufc[-168,], smooth=list(spread=F),
            main="log-Tree height vs tree diameter")
```

\indent All is not lost in this situation, we can consider two other potential 
uses of the log-transformation
and see if they can "fix" the relationship up a bit. One option is to apply the
transformation to the explanatory variable (``y~log(x)``), displayed in 
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-15). If the distribution of the explanatory 
variable is right skewed (see the boxplot on
the $x$-axis), then consider log-transforming the explanatory variable. This will
often reduce the leverage of those most extreme observations which can be
useful. In this situation, it also seems to have been quite successful at 
linearizing the relationship, leaving some minor
non-constant variance, but providing a big improvement from the relationship on
the original scale. 

(ref:fig7-15) Scatterplot of tree height versus log(tree diameter).

```{r Figure7-15,fig.cap="(ref:fig7-15)",echo=F}
scatterplot(height.m~log(dbh.cm), data=ufc[-168,], smooth=list(spread=F),
            main="Tree height vs log-tree diameter")
```

\indent The other option, especially when everything else fails, is to apply the
log-transformation to
both the explanatory and response variables (``log(y)~log(x)``), as
displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-16). For this example, the 
transformation seems to be better than the first two options
(none and only $\log(y)$), but demonstrates some decreasing variability with
larger $x$ and $y$ values. It has also created a new and different curve in the relationship (see the smoothing (dashed) line start below the SLR line, then go above it, and the finish below it). In the end, we might prefer to fit an SLR model to the
tree *height* vs *log(diameter)* versions of the variables 
(Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-15)). 

(ref:fig7-16) Scatterplot of log(tree height) versus log(tree diameter).

            main="log-Tree height vs log-tree diameter")
```

\indent Economists also like to use $\log(y) \sim \log(x)$ transformations. The 
log-log transformation
tends to linearize certain relationships and has specific interpretations in
terms of Economics theory. The log-log transformation shows up in many
different disciplines as a way of obtaining a linear relationship on 
the log-log scale, 
but different fields discuss it differently. The following example shows a
situation where transformations of both $x$ and $y$ are required and 
this double transformation seems to be quite successful in what 
looks like an initially hopeless situation for our linear modeling approach. 

\indent Data were collected in 1988 on the rates of infant mortality 
(infant deaths per 1,000
live births) and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (in 1998 US dollars)
from $n=207$ countries. These data are available from the ``carData`` package 
(@R-carData, @Fox2003) in a data set called ``UN``. 
\index{R packages!\textbf{carData}}
The four panels in 
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-17) show the original relationship and the impacts of
log-transforming one or both variables. 
The only scatterplot that could potentially be modeled using SLR is the lower
right panel (d) that shows the relationship between *log(infant mortality)*
and *log(GDP)*. In the next section, we will fit models to some of these
relationships and use our diagnostic plots to help us assess "success" of 
the transformations. 

(ref:fig7-17) Scatterplots of Infant Mortality vs GDP under four different combinations of log-transformations. 

```{r Figure7-17,fig.cap="(ref:fig7-17)",echo=F,fig.height=5,fig.width=10}

UN <- as_tibble(carData::UN) #Needed to find the correct UN data set from car

```

\indent Almost all nonlinear transformations assume that the variables are strictly
greater than 0. For example, consider what happens when we apply the 
``log`` function to 0 or a negative value in R:

```{r}
log(-1)
log(0)
```

So be careful to think about the domain of the transformation function 
before using transformations.
\index{transformation!caution}
For
example, when using the log-transformation make sure that the data values are
non-zero and positive or you will get some surprises when you go to fit your
regression model to a data set with NaNs (not a number) and/or
$-\infty\text{'s}$ in it. When using fractional powers (square-roots or similar), just having non-negative values are required and so 0 is acceptable.

\indent Sometimes the log-transformations will not be entirely successful. If the
relationship is ***monotonic*** (strictly positive or strictly negative
but not both), then possibly another stop
on the ladder of transformations in Table \@ref(tab:Table7-1) might work.
If the relationship
is not monotonic, then it may be better to consider a more complex regression
model that can accommodate the shape in the relationship or to bin the predictor, response, or both into categories so you can use ANOVA or Chi-square methods and avoid at least the linearity assumption. 

\indent Finally, remember that ``log`` in statistics and especially in R means the 
***natural log*** (*ln* or log base *e* as you might see it elsewhere). In 
these situations, applying the ``log10`` function (which provides log base 10)
to the variables would lead to very similar results, but readers may assume
you used *ln* if you don't state that you used $log_{10}$. The main thing
to remember to do is to be clear when communicating the version you are
using. As an example, I was working with researchers on a study
[@Dieser2010] related to impacts of environmental
stresses on bacterial survival. The response variable was log-transformed
counts and involved smoothed regression lines fit on this scale. I was using
natural logs to fit the models and then shared the fitted values from the
models and my collaborators back-transformed the results assuming that I had
used $log_{10}$. We quickly resolved our differences once we discovered them but
this serves as a reminder at how important communication is in group projects 
-- we both said we were working with log-transformations and didn't know that we
defaulted to different bases. 

------------------------------------------------------------
Generally, in statistics, it's safe to assume
that everything is log base *e* unless otherwise specified.

## Transformations part II: Impacts on SLR interpretations: log(y), log(x), & both log(y) & log(x)	{#section7-6}

\sectionmark{Transformations part II: Impacts on SLR interpretations}

The previous attempts to linearize relationships imply a desire to be 
able to fit SLR models.
\index{transformation}
The *log*-transformations, when successful, 
provide the potential to validly apply our SLR model. There are then two options
for interpretations: you can either interpret the model on the
transformed scale or you can translate the SLR model on the transformed scale
back to the original scale of the variables. It ends up that
*log*-transformations have special interpretations on the original scales
depending on whether the *log* was applied to the response variable, the
explanatory variable, or both.

**Scenario 1: log(y) vs x model:**

\indent First consider the $\log(y) \sim x$ situations where the estimated model
is of the form $\widehat{\log(y)} = b_0 + b_1x$. When only the response is
*log*-transformed, some people call this a ***semi-log model***.
\index{model!semi-log}
But many
researchers will use this model without any special considerations, as
long as it provides
a situation where the SLR assumptions are reasonably well-satisfied. \index{\texttt{exp()}} To
understand the properties and eventually the interpretation of
transformed-variables models, we need to try to "reverse" our transformation. 
If we exponentiate^[Note ``exp(x)`` is the same as $e^{(x)}$ but easier
to read in-line and ``exp()`` is the R function name to execute this calculation.] both sides of $\log(y)=b_0 + b_1x$, we get:

```{r Figure7-18,fig.cap="(ref:fig7-18)",echo=F,fig.height=5,fig.width=10}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(loghectares~Temperature,data=mtfires, main="(a)",ylab="log-Hectares",pch=16,col="salmon")
firem <- lm(loghectares~Temperature,data=mtfires)
abline(lm(loghectares~Temperature,data=mtfires),lwd=2,col="darkred")
plot(hectares~Temperature,data=mtfires, main="(b)",ylab="Hectares",pch=16,col="salmon")
t1 <- seq(from=53,to=60,length.out=30)
lines(exp(firem$coef[1]+firem$coef[2]*t1)~t1,lwd=2,col="darkred")
```

* $\exp(\log(y))=\exp(b_0 + b_1x)$, *which is*

* $y=\exp(b_0 + b_1x)$, *which can be re-written as*

* $y=\exp(b_0)\exp(b_1x)$. *This is based on the rules for* ``exp()`` *where*
$\exp(a+b)=\exp(a)\exp(b)$.

* Now consider what happens if we increase $x$ by 1 unit, going from $x$ 
to $x+1$, providing a new predicted $y$ that we can call $y^*$:
$y^*=\exp(b_0)\exp[b_1(x+1)]$:

* $y^*={\color{red}{\underline{\boldsymbol{\exp(b_0)\exp(b_1x)}}}}\exp(b_1)$. 
*Now note that the underlined, bold component was the y-value for* $x$.

* $y^* = {\color{red}{\boldsymbol{y}}}\exp(b_1)$. *Found by replacing*
$\color{red}{\mathbf{\exp(b_0)\exp(b_1x)}}$ *with* $\color{red}{\mathbf{y}}$,
*the value for* $x$.

\indent So the difference in fitted values between $x$ and $x+1$ is to multiply the
result for $x$ (that was predicting $\color{red}{\mathbf{y}}$) by 
$\exp(b_1)$ to get to the predicted result for $x+1$ (called $y^*$).
We can then use this result to form our $\mathit{\boldsymbol{\log(y)\sim x}}$ 
***slope interpretation***:
\index{slope interpretation!SLR!log transform @$y$}
for a 1 unit increase in $x$, we observe a multiplicative change of
$\mathbf{exp(b_1)}$ in the response. When we compute a mean on logged variables
that are symmetrically distributed (this should occur if our transformation was
successful) and then exponentiate the results, the proper interpretation is
that the changes are happening in the **median** of the original responses.
This is the only time in the course that we will switch our inferences to
medians instead of means, and we don't do this because
we want to, we do it because it is result of modeling on the $\log(y)$ scale, 
if successful. 

\indent When we are working with regression equations, slopes can either be positive or
negative and our interpretations change based on this result to either result
in growth ($b_1>0$) or decay ($b_1<0$) in the responses as the explanatory
variable is increased. As an example, consider $b_1=0.4$ and 
$\exp(b_1)=\exp(0.4)=1.492$. There are a couple of ways to interpret
this on the original scale of the response variable $y$:

For $\mathbf{b_1>0}$:

1. For a 1 unit increase in $x$, the median of $y$ is estimated to change by 1.492 times.

2. We can convert this into a **percentage increase** by subtracting 1 
from $\exp(0.4)$, $1.492-1.0=0.492$ and multiplying the result by 100, 
$0.492*100=49.2\%$. This is interpreted as: For a 1 unit increase in $x$,
the median of $y$ is estimated to increase by 49.2%.

```{r}
exp(0.4)
```

For $\mathbf{b_1<0}$, the change on the *log*-scale is negative and that 
implies on the original scale that the curve decays to 0. For example, 
consider $b_1=-0.3$ and $\exp(-0.3)=0.741$. Again, 
there are two versions of the interpretation possible:

1. For a 1 unit increase in $x$, the median of $y$ is estimated to change by 0.741 times.

2. For negative slope coefficients, the percentage decrease is calculated
as $(1-\exp(b_1))*100\%$. For $\exp(-0.3)=0.741$, this is 
$(1-0.741)*100=25.9\%$. This is interpreted as: For a 1 unit increase
in $x$, the median of $y$ is estimated to decrease by 25.9%. 

We suspect that you will typically prefer interpretation #1 for both 
directions but it is important to be able
think about the results in terms of ***% change of the medians*** to make
the scale of change more understandable. Some examples will help us see how
these ideas can be used in applications. 

\indent For the area burned data set, the estimated regression model is
$\log(\widehat{\text{hectares}})=-69.8+1.39\cdot\text{ Temp}$. On the
original scale, this implies that the model is 
$\widehat{\text{hectares}}=\exp(-69.8)\exp(1.39\text{ Temp})$. 
Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-18) provides the $\log(y)$ scale version of 
the model and the model transformed to the
original scale of measurement. On the log-hectares scale, the interpretation of
the slope is: For a 1$^\circ F$ increase in summer temperature, we 
estimate a 1.39 log-hectares/1$^\circ F$ change, on average, in the log-area
burned. On the original scale: A 1$^\circ F$ increase in temperature is 
related to an estimated multiplicative change in the median number of hectares burned of
$\exp(1.39)=4.01$ times higher areas. That seems like a big rate of growth but the curve does
grow rapidly as shown in panel (b), especially for values over
58$^\circ F$ where the area burned is starting to be really large. You can think
of the multiplicative change here in the following way: the median
number of hectares burned is 4 times higher at 58$^\circ F$ than at 
57$^\circ F$ and the median area burned is 4 times larger at 59$^\circ F$
than at 58$^\circ F$... This can also be interpreted on a % change scale:
A 1$^\circ F$ increase in temperature is related
to an estimated $(4.01-1)*100 = 301\%$ increase in the median number of hectares burned. 

(ref:fig7-18) Plot of the estimated SLR (a) and implied model for the median on the original Hectares scale (b) for the area burned vs temperature data. 

**Scenario 2: y vs log(x) model:**

\indent When only the explanatory variable is log-transformed, it has a 
different sort of
impact on the regression model interpretation.
\index{model!@$\log(x)$}
Effectively we move the
percentage change onto the $x$-scale and modify the first part of our slope
interpretation when we consider the results on the original scale for $x$. Once again, 
we will consider the mathematics underlying the changes in the model and then
work on applying it to real situations. When the explanatory variable is
logged, the estimated regression model is 
$\color{red}{\boldsymbol{y=b_0+b_1\log(x)}}$. This models the relationship
between $y$ and $x$ in terms of multiplicative changes in $x$ having an
effect on the average $y$. To develop an interpretation on the $x$-scale 
(not $\log(x)$), consider the impact of doubling $x$. This change will 
take us from the point ($x,\color{red}{\boldsymbol{y=b_0+b_1\log(x)}}$)
to the point $(2x,\boldsymbol{y^*=b_0+b_1\log(2x)})$. Now the impact of
doubling $x$ can
be simplified using the rules for logs to be:

* $\boldsymbol{y^*=b_0+b_1\log(2x)}$,

* $\boldsymbol{y^*}={\color{red}{\underline{\boldsymbol{b_0+b_1\log(x)}}}} + b_1\log(2)$. &nbsp; *Based on the rules for logs:* $log(2x)=log(x)+log(2)$.

* $y^* = {\color{red}{\boldsymbol{y}}}+b_1\log(2)$

* So if we double $x$, we change the **mean** of $y$ by $b_1\log(2)$.

As before, there are couple of ways to interpret these sorts of results, 
\index{slope interpretation!SLR!log transform @$x$}

1. ***log-scale interpretation of log(x) only model***: for a 1 log-unit
increase in $x$, we estimate a $b_1$ unit change in the mean of $y$ or 

2. ***original scale interpretation of log(x) only model***: for a 
doubling of $x$, we estimate a $b_1\log(2)$ change in the mean of $y$. 
Note that both interpretations are for the mean of the $y\text{'s}$
since we haven't changed the $y\sim$ part of the model. 

(ref:fig7-19) Plot of the observations and estimated SLR model (mortality~ log(GDP)) (top) and implied model (bottom) for the infant mortality data.

```{r Figure7-19,fig.cap="(ref:fig7-19)",echo=F,fig.height=5,fig.width=10}

lines(ID1$coef[1]+ID1$coef[2]*log(ppgdp1)~ppgdp1,lwd=2,col="slateblue4")
```

\indent While it is not a perfect model (no model is), let's consider the model
for *infant mortality* $\sim$ *log(GDP)* in order to practice the 
interpretation using this type of model. This model was estimated to be
$\widehat{\text{infantmortality}}=155.77-14.86\cdot\log(\text{GDP})$. The first
(simplest) interpretation of the slope coefficient is: For a 1 log-dollar
increase in GDP per capita, we estimate infant
mortality to change, on average, by -14.86 deaths/1000 live births. The
second interpretation is on the original GDP scale: For a doubling of GDP, we
estimate infant mortality to change, on average, by $-14.86\log(2) = -10.3$
deaths/1000 live births. Or, the mean infant mortality is reduced by 
10.3 deaths per 1000 live births for each doubling of
GDP. Both versions of the model are displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-19)
-- one on the scale
the SLR model was fit (panel a) and the other on the original $x$-scale (panel b)
that matches these last interpretations. 

\vspace{11pt}

```{r}
ID1 <- lm(infantMortality~log(ppgdp), data=UN)
summary(ID1)
-14.86*log(2)
```

\indent It appears that our model does not fit too well and that there might be
some non-constant variance so we
should check the diagnostic plots (available in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-20))
before we trust
any of those previous interpretations. 

(ref:fig7-20) Diagnostics plots of the infant mortality model with log(GDP). 

```{r Figure7-20,fig.cap="(ref:fig7-20)",fig.height=5,fig.width=10}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(ID1)
```

There appear to be issues with outliers and a long right tail violating
the normality assumption as it suggests a clear right skewed residual distribution. There is
curvature and non-constant variance in the results as well. There are no
influential points, but we are far from happy with this model and will be
revisiting this example with the responses also transformed. Remember that the
log-transformation of the response can potentially fix non-constant variance, 
normality, and curvature issues. 

**Scenario 3: log(y)~log(x) model**

\indent A final model combines log-transformations of both $x$ and $y$, combining the interpretations used in the previous two situations. This model is called the
***log-log model*** and in some fields is also called the ***power law model***.
\index{model!log-log}
\index{model!power law|see {model, log-log}}
The power-law model is usually written as $y = \beta_0x^{\beta_1}+\varepsilon$,
where $y$ is thought to be proportional to $x$ raised to an estimated power
of $\beta_1$ (linear if $\beta_1=1$ and quadratic if $\beta_1=2$). It is 
one of the models that has been used in Geomorphology to model the shape of
glaciated valley elevation profiles
(that classic U-shape that comes with glacier-eroded mountain valleys)^[You can read my dissertation if you want my take on modeling U and V-shaped valley elevation profiles that included some discussion of these models and some related discussions in @Greenwood2002.]. If you
ignore the error term, it is possible to estimate the power-law model using our
SLR approach. Consider the log-transformation of both sides of this equation
starting with the power-law version:

* $\log(y) = \log(\beta_0x^{\beta_1})$,

* $\log(y) = \log(\beta_0) + \log(x^{\beta_1}).$ &nbsp; *Based on the rules
for logs:* $\log(ab) = \log(a) + \log(b)$.

* $\log(y) = \log(\beta_0) + \beta_1\log(x).$ &nbsp; *Based on the rules
for logs:* $\log(x^b) = b\log(x)$.

(ref:fig7-21) Plot of the observations and estimated SLR model log(mortality) $\sim$ log(GDP) (left) and implied model (right) for the infant mortality data.

```{r Figure7-21,fig.cap='(ref:fig7-21)',echo=F}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
ID2 <- lm(log(infantMortality)~log(ppgdp), data=UN)
plot(log(infantMortality)~log(ppgdp),data=UN,pch=16,col="coral",xlab="log-GDP",ylab="log-Infant deaths/1000 births",main="(a) log-Infant Mort. vs log-GDP",cex.main=1)
abline(ID2$coef,lwd=2,col="slateblue3")

plot(infantMortality~ppgdp,data=UN,pch=16,col="coral",xlab="GDP",ylab="Infant deaths/1000 births",main="(b) Infant Mortality vs GDP")

ppgdp1 <- seq(from=30,to=105095.4,length.out=100)
lines(exp(ID2$coef[1]+ID2$coef[2]*log(ppgdp1))~ppgdp1,lwd=2,col="slateblue3")
```

\indent So other than $\log(\beta_0)$ in the model, this looks just like our 
regular SLR model with $x$
and $y$ both log-transformed. The slope coefficient for $\log(x)$ is the 
power coefficient in the original power law model and determines whether
the relationship between the original $x$ and $y$ in $y=\beta_0x^{\beta_1}$
is linear $(y=\beta_0x^1)$ or quadratic $(y=\beta_0x^2)$ or even quartic
$(y=\beta_0x^4)$ in some really heavily glacier carved
U-shaped valleys. There are some issues with "ignoring the errors" in using SLR
to estimate these models [@Greenwood2002] but it is still a
pretty powerful result to be able to estimate the coefficients in
$(y=\beta_0x^{\beta_1})$ using SLR.

\indent We don't typically use
the previous ideas to interpret the typical log-log regression model, instead
we combine our two previous interpretation techniques to generate our
interpretation. We need to work out the mathematics of doubling $x$ and the
changes in $y$ starting with the $\mathit{\boldsymbol{\log(y)\sim \log(x)}}$
***model*** that we would get out of fitting the SLR with both variables
log-transformed:

* $\log(y) = b_0 + b_1\log(x)$,

* $y = \exp(b_0 + b_1\log(x))$. &nbsp; *Exponentiate
both sides*.

* $y = \exp(b_0)\exp(b_1\log(x))=\exp(b_0)x^{b_1}$. &nbsp; *Rules for
exponents and logs, simplifying.*

Now we can consider the impacts of doubling $x$ on $y$, going from 
$(x,{\color{red}{\boldsymbol{y=\exp(b_0)x^{b_1}}}})$ to $(2x,y^*)$ with

* $y^* = \exp(b_0)(2x)^{b_1}$, 

* $y^* = \exp(b_0)2^{b_1}x^{b_1} = 2^{b_1}{\color{red}{\boldsymbol{\exp(b_0)x^{b_1}}}}=2^{b_1}{\color{red}{\boldsymbol{y}}}$

So doubling $x$ leads to a multiplicative change in the median of $y$
of $2^{b_1}$.

\indent Let's apply this idea to the GDP and infant mortality data where a 
$\log(x) \sim \log(y)$ transformation
actually made the resulting relationship look like it might be close to being reasonably modeled with an SLR. The regression line in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-21) actually looks 
pretty good on both
the estimated log-log scale (panel a) and on the original scale (panel b) as it
captures the severe nonlinearity in the relationship between the two variables.

(ref:fig7-22) Diagnostic plots for the log-log infant mortality model.

```{r Figure7-22,fig.cap="(ref:fig7-22)",echo=F,fig.height=5,fig.width=10}
ID2 <- lm(log(infantMortality)~log(ppgdp), data=UN)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(ID2)
```

```{r}
ID2 <- lm(log(infantMortality)~log(ppgdp), data=UN)
summary(ID2)
```

\indent The estimated regression model is
$\log(\widehat{\text{infantmortality}})=8.104-0.617\cdot\log(\text{GDP})$.
The slope coefficient can be interpreted two ways.
\index{slope interpretation!SLR!log transform @$x$ and @$y$}

1. ***On the log-log scale:*** For a 1 log-dollar increase in *GDP*, we estimate, on average,
a change of $-0.617$ log(deaths/1000 live births) in *infant mortality*.

2. ***On the original scale:*** For a doubling of *GDP*, we expect a 
$2^{b_1} = 2^{-0.617} = 0.652$ multiplicative change in the estimated median *infant mortality*. 
That is a 34.8%
decrease in the estimated median *infant mortality* for each doubling of *GDP*. 

The diagnostics of the log-log SLR model (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-22))
show minimal evidence of violations of assumptions although the tails of
the residuals are a little heavy (more spread out than a normal distribution)
and there might still be a little pattern remaining in the residuals vs fitted values. 
\index{Residuals vs Fitted plot}
There are no influential points to be concerned about in this situation.

\indent While we will not revisit this at all except in the case-studies 
in Chapter \@ref(chapter9),
log-transformations can be applied to the response variable in ONE and TWO-WAY
ANOVA models when we are concerned about non-constant variance and
non-normality issues^[This transformation could not be applied directly to the education growth score data in Chapter \@ref(chapter5) because there were negative "growth" scores.]. The remaining methods in this chapter return to SLR and assuming
that the model is at least reasonable to consider in each situation, possibly after transformation(s). In fact, the methods in Section \@ref(section7-7)
are some of the most sensitive results to violations of the assumptions that we
will explore.

\sectionmark{Confidence intervals and prediction intervals}

## Confidence interval for the mean and prediction intervals for a new observation {#section7-7}

\sectionmark{Confidence intervals and prediction intervals}

Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-7) provided a term-plot of the estimated 
regression line and a shaded area surrounding
the estimated regression equation. Those shaded areas are based on connecting
the dots on 95% confidence intervals constructed for the true mean $y$ value
across all the $x$-values. To formalize this idea, consider a specific value 
of $x$, and call it $\boldsymbol{x_{\nu}}$ (pronounced **x-new**^[This silly
nomenclature was inspired by @DeVeaux2011 *Stats: Data and
Models* text. If you find this too cheesy, you can just call it x-vee.]). 
Then the true mean response for this ***subpopulation*** (a subpopulation
is all observations we could obtain at $\boldsymbol{x=x_{\nu}}$) is given by
$\boldsymbol{E(Y)=\mu_\nu=\beta_0+\beta_1x_{\nu}}$. To estimate the mean 
response at $\boldsymbol{x_{\nu}}$, we plug $\boldsymbol{x_{\nu}}$ into the
estimated regression equation: \index{$x_{\nu}$} \index{sub-population} \index{prediction interval}

$$\hat{\mu}_{\nu} = b_0 + b_1x_{\nu}.$$

To form the confidence interval, we appeal to our standard formula of 
$\textbf{estimate} \boldsymbol{\mp t^*}\textbf{SE}_{\textbf{estimate}}$. The
***standard error for the estimated mean at any $x$-value***, denoted 
$\text{SE}_{\hat{\mu}_{\nu}}$, can be calculated as

$$\text{SE}_{\hat{\mu}_{\nu}} 
= \sqrt{\text{SE}^2_{b_1}(x_{\nu}-\bar{x})^2 + \frac{\hat{\sigma}^2}{n}}$$

where $\hat{\sigma}^2$ is the squared residual standard error. This formula
combines the variability in the slope estimate, $\text{SE}_{b_1}$, scaled
based on the distance of $x_{\nu}$ from $\bar{x}$ and the variability
around the regression line, $\hat{\sigma}^2$. Fortunately, R's
``predict`` function can be used to provide these results for us
and avoid doing this calculation by hand most of the time. The
***confidence interval for*** $\boldsymbol{\mu_{\nu}}$, the population
mean response at $x_{\nu}$, is

$$\boldsymbol{\hat{\mu}_{\nu} \mp
t^*_{n-2}}\textbf{SE}_{\boldsymbol{\hat{\mu}_{\nu}}}.$$

In application, these intervals get wider
the further we go from the mean of the $x\text{'s}$. These have 
interpretations that are exactly like those for the y-intercept: 

> For an $x$-value of $\boldsymbol{x_{\nu}}$, we are __% confident that
the true mean of **y** is between **LL** and **UL** **[*units of y*]**. 
> 

It is also useful to remember that this
interpretation applies individually to every $x$ displayed in term-plots.

\indent A second type of interval in this situation takes on a more challenging
task -- to place an interval on where we think a new observation will fall,
called a ***prediction interval*** (PI). \index{prediction interval} This PI will need to be much wider
than the CI for the mean since we need to account for both the uncertainty
in the mean and the
randomness in sampling a new observation from the normal distribution centered
at the true mean for $x_{\nu}$. The interval is centered at the estimated
regression line (where else could we center it?) with the estimate denoted
as $\hat{y}_{\nu}$ to help us see that this interval is for a **new** $y$
at this $x$-value. The $\text{SE}_{\hat{y}_{\nu}}$ incorporates the core of the
previous SE calculation and adds in the variability of a new observation in
$\boldsymbol{\hat{\sigma}^2}$:

$$\text{SE}_{\hat{y}_{\nu}} 
= \sqrt{\text{SE}^2_{b_1}(x_{\nu}-\bar{x})^2 + \dfrac{\hat{\sigma}^2}{n} 
+ \boldsymbol{\hat{\sigma}^2}}
= \sqrt{\text{SE}_{\hat{\mu}_{\nu}}^2 + \boldsymbol{\hat{\sigma}^2}}$$

The __% PI is calculated as

$$\boldsymbol{\hat{y}_{\nu} \mp t^*_{n-2}}\textbf{SE}_{\boldsymbol{\hat{y}_{\nu}}}$$

and interpreted as:

> We are __% sure that a new observation at $\boldsymbol{x_{\nu}}$ will be between
> **LL** and **UL** **[*units of y*]**. Since 
> $\text{SE}_{\hat{y}_{\nu}} > \text{SE}_{\hat{\mu}_{\nu}}$, the **PI will always
> be wider than the CI**. 
>


\indent As in confidence
intervals, we assume that a 95% PI "succeeds" -- now when it succeeds it contains the new observation --
in 95% of applications of the methods and fails the other 5% of the time. 
Remember that for any interval estimate, the true value is either in the
interval or it is not and our confidence level essentially sets our failure
rate! Because PIs push into the tails of the assumed distribution of the
responses these methods are very sensitive to violations of assumptions so we
should not use these if there are any concerns about violations of assumptions as they will work as advertised (at the ***nominal*** (specified) level).

\indent There are two ways to explore CIs for the mean and PIs for a new observation.
The first is to focus on a specific $x$-value of interest. The second is to 
plot the results for all $x\text{'s}$. To do both of these, but especially
to make plots, we want to learn to use the ``predict`` function. It can 
either produce the estimate for a particular $x_{\nu}$ and the 
$\text{SE}_{\hat{\mu}_{\nu}}$ or we can get it to directly calculate 
the CI and PI. The first way to use it is ``predict(MODELNAME, se.fit=T)``
which will provide fitted values and $\text{SE}_{\hat{\mu}_{\nu}}$
for all observed $x\text{'s}$. We can then use the 
$\text{SE}_{\hat{\mu}_{\nu}}$ to calculate $\text{SE}_{\hat{y}_{\nu}}$
and form our own PIs. If you want CIs, run 
``predict(MODELNAME, interval= "confidence")``; if you want PIs, run 
``predict(MODELNAME, interval="prediction")``. If you want to do 
prediction at an $x$-value that was not in the original
observations, add the option ``newdata=tibble(XVARIABLENAME_FROM_ORIGINAL_MODEL=Xnu)``
to the ``predict`` function call.

\indent Some examples of using the predict function follow^[I have suppressed 
some of the code for making plots in this and the next chapter to make
"pretty" pictures - which you probably are happy to not see it until you want
to make a pretty plot on your own. All the code used is available upon
request.]. For example, it might be interesting to use the regression 
model to find a 95%
CI and PI for the *Beers* vs *BAC* study for a student who would
consume 8 beers. Four different applications of the predict function follow. 
Note that ``lwr`` and ``upr`` in the output depend on what we
requested. The first use of ``predict`` just returns the estimated mean 
for 8 beers:

```{r}
m1 <- lm(BAC~Beers, data=BB)
predict(m1, newdata=tibble(Beers=8))
```

By turning on the ``se.fit=T`` option, we also get the SE for the 
confidence interval and degrees of freedom.
\index{degrees of freedom!SLR}
Note that elements returned 
are labelled as ``$fit``, ``$se.fit``, etc. and provide some of the information to calculate CIs or PIs "by hand".

```{r}
predict(m1, newdata=tibble(Beers=8), se.fit=T)
```

Instead of using the components of the intervals to
make them, we can also directly request the CI or PI using the 
``interval=...`` option, as in the following two lines of code. 

```{r}
predict(m1, newdata=tibble(Beers=8), interval="confidence")
predict(m1, newdata=tibble(Beers=8), interval="prediction")
```

\indent Based on these results, we are 95% confident that the true mean *BAC*
for 8 beers consumed is between 0.111 and 0.15 grams of alcohol per dL of
blood. For a new student drinking 8 beers, we are 95% sure that the observed
BAC will be between 0.083 and 0.179 g/dL. You can see from these results that
the PI is much wider than the CI -- it has to capture a new individual's results
95% of the time which is much harder than trying to capture the true mean at 8 beers consumed. For
completeness, we should do these same calculations "by hand". The 
``predict(..., se.fit=T)`` output provides almost all the pieces we need 
to calculate the CI and PI. The ``$fit`` is the 
$\text{estimate} = \hat{\mu}_{\nu}=0.131$, the ``$se.fit`` is the SE 
for the estimate of the $\text{mean} = \text{SE}_{\hat{\mu}_{\nu}}=0.0092$
, ``$df`` is $n-2 = 16-2=14$, and ``$residual.scale`` is
$\hat{\sigma}=0.02044$. So we just need the $t^*$ multiplier for 95% 
confidence and 14 *df*:

```{r}
qt(0.975, df=14) # t* multiplier for 95% CI or 95% PI
```

The 95% CI for the true mean at $\boldsymbol{x_{\nu}=8}$ is then:

```{r}
0.131 + c(-1,1)*2.1448*0.0092
```

Which matches the previous output quite well. 

The 95% PI requires the calculation of 
$\sqrt{\text{SE}_{\hat{\mu}_{\nu}}^2 + \boldsymbol{\hat{\sigma}^2}} = \sqrt{(0.0092)^2+(0.02044)^2}=0.0224$. 

```{r}
sqrt(0.0092^2 + 0.02044^2)
```


The 95% PI at $\boldsymbol{x_{\nu}=8}$ is

```{r}
0.131 + c(-1,1)*2.1448*0.0224
```

\indent These calculations are "fun" and informative but displaying these results
for all $x$-values is a bit more
informative about the performance of the two types of intervals and for results
we might expect in this application. The calculations we just performed provide
endpoints of both intervals at ``Beers``= 8. To make this plot, we need to
create a sequence of *Beers* values to get other results for, say from 0 to 10 beers,
using the ``seq`` function. The ``seq`` function requires three arguments, that the endpoints (``from`` and ``to``) are defined and
the ``length.out``, which defines the resolution of the grid of equally spaced points
to create. Here, ``length.out=30`` provides 30 points evenly spaced between 0 and 10 and is more than enough to make
the confidence and prediction intervals from 0 to 10 *Beers*. \index{\texttt{seq()}}

```{r}
beerf <- seq(from=0, to=10, length.out=30)
head(beerf,6)
tail(beerf,6)
```

Now we can call the ``predict`` function at the values stored in
``beerf`` to get the CIs across that range of *Beers* values:

```{r}
BBCI <- as_tibble(predict(m1, newdata=tibble(Beers=beerf), interval="confidence"))
head(BBCI)
```


And the PIs:

```{r}
BBPI <- as_tibble(predict(m1, newdata=tibble(Beers=beerf), interval="prediction"))
head(BBPI)
```

The rest of the code is just making a scatterplot and adding the five lines
with a legend. The ``lines`` function connects the points with a line that provided and only works to add lines to the previously made ``plot``. \index(\texttt(lines())) 

(ref:fig7-23) Estimated SLR for BAC data with 95% confidence (darker, dashed lines) and 95% prediction (lighter, dotted lines) intervals.

       col = c("blue","red","grey")) #Add a legend to explain lines
```

More importantly, note that the CI in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-23) clearly 
shows widening as we move further away from the mean of the
$x\text{'s}$ to the edges of the observed $x$-values. This reflects a decrease
in knowledge of the true mean as we move away from the mean of the 
$x\text{'s}$. The PI
also is widening slightly but not as clearly in this situation. The difference
in widths in the two types of intervals becomes extremely clear when they are
displayed together, with the PI much wider than the CI for any $x$-value. 

\indent Similarly, the 95% CI and PIs for the Bozeman yearly average maximum
temperatures in Figure \@ref(fig:Figure7-24) provide
interesting information on the uncertainty in the estimated mean temperature
over time. It is also interesting to explore how many of the observations fall
within the 95% prediction intervals. The PIs are for new observations, but you
can see how the PIs that were constructed to contain almost all the
observations in the original data set but not all of them. In fact, only 2 of
the 109 observations (1.8%) fall outside the 95% PIs. Since the PI needs to be
concerned with unobserved new observations it makes sense that it might contain
more than 95% of the observations used to make it. 

(ref:fig7-24) Estimated SLR for Bozeman temperature data with 95% confidence (dashed lines) and 95% prediction (lighter, dotted lines) intervals. 

```{r Figure7-24,fig.cap="(ref:fig7-24)",echo=T,fig.height=5,fig.width=10}
temp1 <- lm(meanmax~Year, data=bozemantemps)
Yearf <- seq(from=1901,to=2014,length.out=75)
 
TCI <- as_tibble(predict(temp1,newdata= tibble(Year=Yearf),interval="confidence"))

TPI <- as_tibble(predict(temp1,newdata=tibble(Year=Yearf),interval="prediction"))

plot(meanmax~Year,data=bozemantemps,xlab="Year", ylab="degrees F", col="darkgreen",
     pch=20, main="Scatterplot of estimated regression line with 95% CI and PI")
lines(fit~Yearf,data=TCI,col="blue",lwd=3)
lines(lwr~Yearf,data=TCI,col="red",lty=2,lwd=3)
lines(upr~Yearf,data=TCI,col="red",lty=2,lwd=3)
lines(lwr~Yearf,data=TPI,col="grey",lty=3,lwd=3)
lines(upr~Yearf,data=TPI,col="grey",lty=3,lwd=3)
legend("topleft", c("Estimate", "CI","PI"),lwd=3,lty=c(1,2,3),
       col = c("blue", "red","grey"))
```

\indent We can also use these same methods to do a prediction for the year after the
data set ended, 2015, and in 2050:

```{r}
predict(temp1, newdata=tibble(Year=2015), interval="confidence")
```

```{r}
predict(temp1, newdata=tibble(Year=2015), interval="prediction")
```

```{r}
predict(temp1, newdata=tibble(Year=2050), interval="confidence")
```

```{r}
predict(temp1, newdata=tibble(Year=2050), interval="prediction")
```

These results tell us that we are 95% confident that the true mean yearly
average maximum temperature in 2015 is (I guess "was") between 
55.04$^\circ F$ and 61.6$^\circ F$. And we are 95% sure that the observed
yearly average maximum temperature in 2015 will be (I guess "would have been")
between 59.2$^\circ F$ and 61.1$^\circ F$. Obviously, 2015 has occurred, but
since the data were not published when the data set was downloaded in July
2016, we can probably best treat 2015 as a potential "future" observation. The
results for 2050 are clearly for the future mean and a new observation^[I have really enjoyed writing this book but kind of hope to at least have updated this data set before 2050.] in 2050. 
Note that up to 2014, no values of this response had been observed above 60$^\circ F$ and the predicted mean in 2050 is over 60$^\circ F$ if the trend
persists. It is easy to criticize the use of this model for 2050 because of its extreme amount
of extrapolation.

## Chapter summary {#section7-8}

In this chapter, we raised our SLR modeling to a new level, considering
inference techniques for relationships between two quantitative variables. The next 
chapter will build on these same techniques but add in additional explanatory
variables for what is called ***multiple linear regression*** (MLR) modeling. For example,
in the *Beers* vs *BAC* study, it would have been useful to control for the
weight of the subjects since people of different sizes metabolize alcohol at
different rates and body size might explain some of the variability in *BAC*. We still
would want to study the effects of beer consumption but also would be able to control for the
differences in subject's weights. Or if they had studied both male and female
students, we might need to change the slope or intercept based on gender, allowing
the relationship between *Beers* and *BAC* to change between these groups.
That will also be handled using MLR techniques but result in two simple linear
regression equations -- one for each group. 

\indent In this chapter
you learned how to interpret SLR models. The next chapter will feel like it is
completely new initially but it actually contains very little new material,
just more complicated models that use the same concepts. There will be a
couple of new issues to consider for MLR and we'll need to learn how to work
with categorical variables in a regression setting -- but we actually fit
linear models with categorical variables in Chapters \@ref(chapter2), \@ref(chapter3), and 
\@ref(chapter4) so that isn't actually completely new either. 

\indent SLR is a simple (thus its name) tool for analyzing the relationship 
between two
quantitative variables. It contains assumptions about the estimated regression
line being reasonable and about the distribution of the responses around that
line to do inferences for the population regression line.
\index{assumptions}
Our diagnostic plots
help us to carefully assess those assumptions. If we cannot trust the
assumptions, then the estimated line and any inferences for the population are
un-trustworthy. Transformations can fix things so that we can use SLR to fit
regression models. Transformations can complicate the interpretations on the
original, untransformed scale but have minimal impact on the interpretations on
the transformed scale. It is important to be careful with the units of the
variables, especially when dealing with transformations, as this can lead to
big changes in the results depending on which scale (original or transformed)
the results are being interpreted on.

## Summary of important R code {#section7-9}

The main components of the R code used in this chapter follow with the
components to modify in lighter and/or ALL CAPS text where ``y`` is a response variable, ``x`` is an
explanatory variable, and the data are in ``DATASETNAME``. 

* **scatterplot(`r colFmt("y","red")`~`r colFmt("x","red")`,
data=`r colFmt("DATASETNAME","red")`, smooth=F)**

    * Requires the ``car`` package.
    
    * Provides a scatterplot with a regression line.

    * Turn on ``smooth=T`` to add a smoothing line to help detect 
    nonlinear relationships.
    \index{\texttt{scatterplot()}|textbf}
    
* **`r colFmt("MODELNAME","red")` ``<-`` lm(`r colFmt("y","red")`~
`r colFmt("x","red")`, data=`r colFmt("DATASETNAME","red")`)**

    * Estimates a regression model using least squares.
    \index{\texttt{lm()}|textbf}
    
* **summary(`r colFmt("MODELNAME","red")`)**

    * Provides parameter estimates and R-squared (used heavily in 
    Chapter \@ref(chapter8) as well).
    \index{\texttt{summary()}|textbf}
    
* **par(mfrow=c(2, 2)); plot(`r colFmt("MODELNAME","red")`)**

    * Provides four regression diagnostic plots in one plot.
    
* **confint(`r colFmt("MODELNAME","red")`, level=0.95)**

    * Provides 95% confidence intervals for the regression model coefficients.
    
    * Change ``level`` if you want other confidence levels.
    \index{\texttt{confint()}|textbf}
    
* **plot(allEffects(`r colFmt("MODELNAME","red")`))**
    
    * Requires the ``effects`` package. 

    * Provides a term-plot of the estimated regression line with 95% confidence
    interval for the mean. \index{\texttt{allEffects()}|textbf}
    
* **`r colFmt("DATASETNAME\\$log.y","red")` ``<-`` log(`r colFmt("DATASETNAME\\$y","red")`)**

    * Creates a transformed variable called log.y -- change this to be more
    specific to your "$y$" or "$x$".
    \index{\texttt{log()}|textbf}
    
* **predict(`r colFmt("MODELNAME","red")`, se.fit=T)**

    * Provides fitted values for all observed $x\text{'s}$ with SEs for the 
    mean.
    \index{\texttt{predict()}|textbf}

* **predict(`r colFmt("MODELNAME","red")`, 
newdata=tibble(`r colFmt("x","red")` = `r colFmt("XNEW","red")`),
interval="confidence")**

    * Provides fitted value for a specific $x$ (XNEW) with CI for the mean.
    Replace ``x`` with name of explanatory variable. 

* **predict(`r colFmt("MODELNAME","red")`, 
newdata=tibble(`r colFmt("x","red")` = `r colFmt("XNEW","red")`),
interval="prediction")**

    * Provides fitted value for a specific $x$ (XNEW) with PI for a new
    observation. Replace ``x`` with name of explanatory variable.
    
* **qt(0.975, df=`r colFmt("n","red")` - 2)**

    * Gets the $t^*$ multiplier for making a 95% confidence or prediction interval with $n-2$ replaced
    by the sample size -- 2.
    \index{\texttt{qt()}|textbf}

## Practice problems	{#section7-10}

7.1. **Treadmill data analysis** We will continue with the treadmill data set introduced in Chapter 
\@ref(chapter1) and the SLR fit in the practice problems in
Chapter \@ref(chapter6). The following code will get you back to where we 
stopped at the end of Chapter \@ref(chapter6):

```r
treadmill <- read_csv("http://www.math.montana.edu/courses/s217/documents/treadmill.csv")
plot(TreadMillOx~RunTime, data=treadmill)
tm <- lm(TreadMillOx~RunTime, data=treadmill)
summary(tm1)
```

7.1.1. Use the output to test for a
linear relationship between treadmill oxygen and run time, writing out all 6+
steps of the hypothesis test. Make sure to address scope of inference and
interpret the p-value. 

7.1.2. Form and interpret a 95%
confidence interval for the slope coefficient "by hand" using the provided
multiplier:

```{r}
qt(0.975, df=29)
```

7.1.3. Use the ``confint`` function to find a similar confidence interval,
checking your previous calculation. 

7.1.4. Use the ``predict`` function to find fitted values, 95% confidence, and 95%
prediction intervals for run times of 11 and 16 minutes. 

7.1.5. Interpret the CI and PI for the 11 minute run time. 

7.1.6. Compare the width of either set of CIs and PIs -- why are they different?
For the two different predictions, why are the intervals wider for 16 minutes
than for 11 minutes?

7.1.7. The Residuals vs Fitted plot considered in Chapter \@ref(chapter6) should
have suggested slight non-constant variance and maybe a little missed
nonlinearity. Perform a log-transformation of the treadmill oxygen response
variable and re-fit the SLR model. Remake the diagnostic plots and discuss
whether the transformation changed any of them. 

7.1.8 Summarize the $\log(y) \sim x$ model and interpret the slope coefficient on
the transformed and original scales, regardless of the answer to the previous
question.
